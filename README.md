# PyPixel - A python project to pull and display player data from the Hypixel API
This is a small python project I am working on.

My goal with this is to learn about APIs and get experience working with JSON, whilst making a project to view your player stats on the SkyBlock minigame.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT REQUIRES A HYPIXEL API KEY TO RUN

API keys can be obtained by logging into the Hypixel server and running the command '/api new' in chat.

# Instructions for use
1. Clone this repository

2. Open exampleconfig.json

3. Fill in your API key where it says

4. Save the file as 'config.json'

5. Open main.py and run it!

# Notes
Make sure you have installed the requests module!

For the best experience, run this project from the command line, rather than in an IDE.
