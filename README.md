# PyPixel - A python project to pull and display player data from the Hypixel API
This is a small python project I am working on.

My goal with this is to learn about APIs and get experience working with JSON, whilst making a project to view your player stats on the SkyBlock minigame.

# NOTE: THIS PROJECT REQUIRES A HYPIXEL API KEY TO RUN
API keys can be obtained by logging into the Hypixel server and running the command '/api new' in chat.
